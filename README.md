## Hi there, my name is Ben ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. I currently wokring towards my Bachelor of Applied Science in IT Networing - Cybersecurity. I plan to graduate in Spring of 2027.

Some projects I have worked on:

## - Linked Lists (Java): (https://github.com/Raphaelexander/Phone-Book)
  - This Phonebook program creates a linked list from the user input, storing each input as a node of a list, and a next node that holds the information of the node after. It creates different lists for every unique person the user wants to store
## - Black Jack Game (Java): (https://github.com/Raphaelexander/CS145-CardGame)
  - This program uses enums to create a deck of cards and store into an array list. The program then shuffles the cards and deals them to the dealer and player. The user has the option to hit on their hand or hold, in order to reach as close to 21 as possible
## - Binary Search Tree (Java): (https://github.com/Raphaelexander/BST)
  - This binary search tree is an example of data structures at work. This program inserts names into a tree, and then displays to the console the names sorted by in, pre, and post order.

While I continue my education, I continuously start and update projects to deepen my learning. Currently my expertise is in Java and Python. I use different data structures to create programs in a quick and efficient manner. I have also utilized Powershell and Linux to harden machines against threat actors.

In the future I look forward to create more complex programs as well as designing and maintaining network hardware
