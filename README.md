## Hi there, my name is Ben ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. I currently wokring towards my Bachelor of Applied Science in IT Networing - Cybersecurity. I plan to graduate in Spring of 2027.

Some projects I have worked on:

While I continue my education, I continuously start and update projects to deepen my learning. Currently my expertise is in Java and Python. I use different data structures to create programs in a quick and efficient manner. I have also utilized Powershell and Linux to harden machines against threat actors.

In the future I look forward to create more complex programs as well as designing and maintaining network hardware
